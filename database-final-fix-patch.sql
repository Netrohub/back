-- QUICK PATCH: Fix the user_id error and add missing is_featured column

-- First, add the critical missing column that's causing API errors
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Copy data from 'featured' to 'is_featured' if featured column exists
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'products' AND column_name = 'featured') THEN
        UPDATE products SET is_featured = featured WHERE is_featured IS DISTINCT FROM featured;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Copied featured -> is_featured data';
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Skip the user_id copy since that column doesn't exist (data is likely already correct)
-- Just ensure we have some buyer_id values if orders exist without them
UPDATE orders 
SET buyer_id = 1  -- Set to a default user ID, adjust as needed
WHERE buyer_id IS NULL 
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = 1);

-- Verify the critical fields exist
